== Talk Outline

* What is [.emph]#CI/CD#?
* HPC challenges
* CI/CD, [.emph]#Tapis#, and TACC
* Case 1: HPC-enabled [.emph]#integration testing#
* Case 2: [.emph]#Scientific experiments# through CI/CD
* Conclusion


[%notitle]
== What is CI/CD?

[.statement]
What is [.emph]#Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)#?

== CI/CD

* [.emph]#Continuous integration# typically refers to automation of build and tests.
* [.emph]#Continuous deployment and delivery# refer to automating the deployment of software changes to customers.

[.purple.bold]#Both aspects of CICD significantly increase developer productivity and code quality, so it's no surprise that it has become standard practice!#

== HPC Challenges for CI/CD

* [.emph]#Integration tests# for an HPC app typically need to run on the same
[.emph]#HPC resources# as production
* HPC systems may be protected by [.emph]#two-factor authentication#
* Tasks on HPC may not [.emph]#execute immediately# (job queue)

[.columns]
== CI/CD, Tapis, and TACC

[.column.is-two-thirds]
* One solution: https://tapis-project.org/[Tapis]
* [.emph]#web-based API# for interacting with computational and 
storage systems
* allows [.emph]#queuing jobs# with batch systems using [.emph]#API calls#
* provides [.emph]#webhook interaction# on job events

[%notitle]
== Tapis CI/CD idea

[.statement]
[.purple]#Idea:# use [.emph]#Tapis# to enable [.emph]#GitHub or GitLab# based 
CI/CD pipelines
to interact with [.emph]#HPC systems#

== Use Cases for CI/CD in Science

1. [.emph]#Integration tests# in an HPC environment
2. [.emph]#Reproducible and documented# CI/CD-based [.emph]#science workflows#

== Case 1: HPC-Enabled Code Testing

[.text-less-small]
Special thanks to [.emph]#Benjamin Pachev# for this section!

Case study: [.purple.bold]#PYOPATRA (PYthon Ocean PArticle TRAcking)#

* HPC application for [.emph]#Lagrangian particle tracking#
* Applications: oil spill modeling and inversion, fish modeling, air particle 
modeling, etc

== PYOPATRA HPC Concerns

1. [.purple.bold]#Is the mesh set up correctly?#
+
The mesh needs to be [.emph]#identically constructed# on each 
[.emph]#compute node# in [.emph]#shared memory# accessible by all MPI tasks

2. [.purple.bold]#Are particles distributed across tasks and nodes correctly?#
+
PYOPATRA is [.emph]#embarassingly parallel#, but particles need to be balanced
over MPI tasks and nodes

== PYOPATRA HPC Concerns

[start=3]
3. [.purple.bold]#Do particles propagate through the mesh correctly?# 
+
The [.emph]#time-lapse propagation# or [.emph]#ending position of the particles#
is the output from LPT

4. [.purple.bold]#Does the performance scale as expected?# 
+
It's easy to introduce [.emph]#inefficiencies# that affect performance

[%notitle]
== PYOPATRA HPC Concerns

[.statement]
[.purple]#All of these concerns require HPC to resolve, and all should be 
verified when the code is changed!#

== PYOPATRA CI/CD Tech Stack

* https://github.com/features/actions[Github Actions] for representing and 
launching CI workflows.
* https://tapis-project.org/[Tapis V2] for bypassing 2fa 
and dealing with the job queue on 
https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2[Stampede2].
* A https://jetstream-cloud.org/[Jetstream] VM to facilitate communication 
between Github Actions and TAPIS.
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] and 
https://apptainer.org/[Singularity/Apptainer] for containerization 
of the PYOPATRA application.

== PYOPATRA CI/CD Workflow

image::flowchart.png[]

== Tapis Testing Application

[.text-less-small]
* https://github.com/UT-CHG/hpc-cicd[Generic application] that can run integration tests for any [.emph]#containerized HPC app#
* Specified by a [.emph]#registry URL# pointing to the application image to download and convert to Singularity
* Tests are defined by a [.emph]#setup script (optional), main run script, supplementary files#
* Tests are run by singularity exec with the downloaded image and test files
* https://github.com/UT-CHG/PYOPATRA/tree/hpc-tests/test/hpc_tests[Example here]!

== Tapis Testing Application

image::flowchart2.png[]

== The Job Queue

* Tests are [.emph]#submitted as jobs# and have to [.emph]#wait in the queue# before executing
* Wait times can be long, so we need a way to [.emph]#detect job completion# without polling Tapis
* Tapis supports posting job status updates to a provided [.emph]#webhook#

== Reproducible Science

[.purple.bold]#Reproducing computational science experiments is rife with problems#

* [.emph]#Research code changes!# [.text-small]#(It worked last year...)#
* [.emph]#Packages available for installation change!# [.text-small]#(It worked on the last distro...)#
* [.emph]#Maintaining experiment inputs, outputs, and metadata is difficult!# [.text-small]#(It worked with these long lost inputs...)#
* [.emph]#Tranferring between workstations and different HPC systems is difficult!# [.text-small]#(It worked on my computer...)#

[%notitle]
== Scientific Experiments

[.statement]
[.purple]#Idea:# leverage Tapis to promote [.emph]#reproducible science# on HPC system


== Some solutions

* [.purple.bold]#Containerization!#
+
[.text-less-small]
Keep [.emph]#container images#, not just reciples (the internet is [.emph]#not reproducible#)

* [.purple.bold]#Backup inputs, outputs, and metadata to an organized and _backed up_ system#
+
[.text-less-small]
Potential solutions: [.emph]#Ranch @ TACC#, [.emph]#S3 buckets#, [.emph]#git repository hosting for metadata repos#

* To tie it together... [.purple.bold]#Tapis!#
+
[.text-less-small]
Tapis can [.emph]#automate# job submission, metadata creation, and input/output archiving

== Tapis CI/CD for Science Tech Stack

* https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/[GitLab Pipelines] for launching workflows
* https://tapis-project.org/[Tapis V3] for managing authentication to the [.emph]#Europa# HPC system and
an [.emph]#AWS S3 bucket# 
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] and 
https://apptainer.org/[Singularity/Apptainer] for containerization of the applications

== Test Case: Seismic MCMC

* [.emph]#Seismic inversion# with [.emph]#Markov chain Monte Carlo# gives a "view of the subsurface" with 
uncertainty information by inverting [.emph]#seismic waves#

* [.purple.bold]#Massively computationally expensive# and requires [.emph]#many replications (chains)# 
of the experiment to build the uncertainty distributions

* On most HPC systems, requires [.emph]#checkpointing and restarting experiments repeatedly#

== Tapis CI/CD for Science Setup

1. Create [.emph]#Tapis Systems# for your HPC and storage systems (or use TACC's!)
2. Create a [.emph]#Tapis app# describing how your (containerized) workflow runs
3. Create a [.emph]#Tapis job template# that will be used to describe specific jobs 

== Tapis CI/CD for Science Workflow

1. Stage your [.emph]#application container# on your run system (may be automated in the future)
2. Commit and push your [.emph]#job template and input files# to the GitLab repository 
3. [.emph]#Trigger the workflow# (manually or automatically on push)

== GitLab Pipeline & Tapis

After launch the GitLab pipeline...

1. [.purple.bold]#Stages input files on the execution system with the Tapis API#
+
Inputs can come from [.emph]#the GitLab repo# or from [.emph]#the storage system#

2. [.purple.bold]#Creates the job description from the job template#

3. [.purple.bold]#Uses Tapipy to submit the job to the execution system#

== After job completion

1. [.purple.bold]#Tapis notifies the GitLab pipeline with a# [.emph]#webhook#

2. [.purple.bold]#The pipeline moves artifacts from the run to the storage system with the Tapis API#

3. [.purple.bold]#The pipeline writes final metadata and commits it to the repository# 

== Benefits

* Experiments are [.emph]#uniquely identified# and all artifacts are stored to long-term storage upon job completion
* Experiment metadata is [.emph]#Automatically created and commited to a git repository#
* Experiments are [.emph]#assigned to a specific version of the Tapis app# for reproducibility

== Conclusion

* [.emph]#CI/CD# methodology is useful for both [.emph]#testing# and 
[.emph]#creating reproducible science experiments#
* [.emph]#Tapis# is a great tool for CI/CD integration tests and [.emph]#SCIENCE#!
